# Improvements to `Brain_Segmentation.py`

In our pursuit to enhance the U-Net model's performance for brain MRI segmentation, we've introduced several modifications. These changes are aimed at addressing potential overfitting, ensuring better convergence, and enhancing segmentation accuracy.

## Batch Normalization

### What
Added `BatchNormalization()` layers after each convolutional layer in the U-Net architecture.

### Why
Batch normalization can improve the training process by reducing internal covariate shift. It normalizes the activations of each layer, which can lead to faster convergence and improved generalization.

## Dropout Layers

### What
Introduced `Dropout()` layers in the U-Net architecture.

### Why
Dropout is a regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting. By randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training, it forces the network to learn redundant representations, making it more robust.

## Modified Loss Function

### What
Introduced a combined loss function that merges binary cross-entropy and the Dice coefficient.

### Why
The Dice coefficient is a metric that measures the overlap between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth. By using it as a loss function, we directly optimize for the quality of the segmentation. Combining it with binary cross-entropy ensures that the model also focuses on classifying each voxel correctly.

## Deeper U-Net Architecture

### What
Enhanced the depth of the U-Net model by adding more convolutional layers.

### Why
A deeper network can capture more complex features from the MRI data. However, it's essential to balance the depth with the risk of overfitting, which is why dropout and batch normalization were also added.

## Code Changes

Here's a snippet of the changes made to the `Brain_Segmentation.py`:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import BatchNormalization, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.losses import binary_crossentropy

# New Dice Loss Function
def dice_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    ...

# Combined Loss (Dice + Binary Cross Entropy)
def combined_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    ...

# Modified U-Net with BatchNormalization and Dropout
def create_unet_model():
    ...
    c1 = BatchNormalization()(c1)
    c1 = Dropout(0.2)(c1)
    ...
    c2 = BatchNormalization()(c2)
    c2 = Dropout(0.2)(c2)
    ...
    c3 = BatchNormalization()(c3)
    c3 = Dropout(0.3)(c3)
    ...
    c4 = BatchNormalization()(c4)
    c4 = Dropout(0.2)(c4)
    ...
    c5 = BatchNormalization()(c5)
    c5 = Dropout(0.2)(c5)
    ...
